/**
 * @brief A slot in a moving column: hold (angle, range) relative to a
 * leader's heading, re-deriving the spot on a fixed cadence and walking
 * each leg through the router.
 *
 * The distinction from Follow is the whole point. Follow chases the
 * leader's CURRENT position independently every tick, which in a crowd
 * knots the column and rubber-bands stragglers. A formation slot aims
 * where the leader is GOING - the final destination of his live spline -
 * so members swing wide, keep their spacing through turns, and arrive as
 * ranks. TrinityCore's FormationMovementGenerator works the same way, on
 * the same sniffed cadence (three batch update cycles).
 *
 * Every leg is routed with MOVE_REQUIRE_PATH: a member whose slot is
 * momentarily unroutable pauses a beat and retries, rather than walking
 * through a wall to keep station.
